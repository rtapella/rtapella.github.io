                        <p>Pacific Biosciences develops DNA sequencing technology, including hardware instrumentation
                            with embedded control software, biochemical reagents, and data analysis software.</p>
                        <p>As the product manager for the instrument and for its embedded and run-tracking software, I
                            visited a number of customer sites to observe and interview the technicians who ran our
                            installed instruments, and the lab managers who were responsible for capital equipment
                            purchases and for ongoing management of lab services. By engaging with the customers
                            continuously, and by including the service and support staff's expertise, we created an
                            all-new web-based run monitoring and quality-control software that was validated with real
                            users before launching it.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">CONCLUSION AND IMPACT</h2>
                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p>There were some assumptions built into the software design of the original PacBio RS
                            instrument that turned out to be false once the instruments began to be installed in the
                            field. I was able to help improve the instrument run-monitoring and data-QC software both in
                            terms of the information presented, as well as in the manifestation. Internal teams who had
                            built custom software to address pain points began to use the built-in software instead,
                            which helped to further validate its completeness and utility.</p>
                        <p>Findings from the research also influenced the development of the PacBio Sequel System
                            embedded- and run-monitoring-software.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">ADDITIONAL RESULTS</h2>
                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p>Based on the observations during my customer visits, other changes were made. For example,
                            packaging was updated to reflect how the technicians' labs were set up, and how instrument
                            runs were documented and tracked. For example, barcode scanning of the boxes was often a
                            pain because the scanner computer was by the instrument, which was not necessarily next to
                            the fridge where reagents were stored. The simple improvement to help with this problem was
                            to put an additional barcode sticker inside the reagents box that could be stored near the
                            computer and stuck into a lab notebook for record-keeping.</p>

                        <p>For this project, I closely followed the Cooper Goal-Directed Design process, including the
                            creation of personas and scenarios to generate narratives around the use of the software. I
                            was able to rely on the user research methods that I had developed previously with Applied
                            Biosystems and a collaborative project with IDEO.</p>
