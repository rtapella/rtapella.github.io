                    <p>I am a designer and product manager who takes a strategic end-to-end approach to making interactive products.</p>
                    <br>    
                    <p>I feel that user research is critical to decision-making during the product definition process, and in obtaining feedback while iterating on designs. To me, design is about both building and understanding. While best practices and experience can absolutely help to create engaging interactions, identifying the specific goals, contexts, and behaviors of users is necessary to focus and organize a solution to a real problem. I look at products from many angles including commercial, technical, and from the end-user experience.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My background is in life science research tools like DNA sequencers, real-time PCR products, genome sequence databases and genomics knowledge management software. Now I work at JPL designing some space software and mostly not-space search software. I am also helping to figure out how JPL can assist California's water managers with remote-sensing data. I like working with complex systems, particularly those that include a combination digital and real-world interactions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am interested in science, health care, tea and coffee, travel, culture, languages, history and archaeology. Discovering new perspectives on the world keeps me exploring. I also have about seven email apps on my phone and like to try out new styles of calendars and to-dos.</p>
