                    <p>Our three-person team created a service journey map for the Luxe Valet product—a now-defunct
                        valet-parking on-demand app. We felt that Luxe would benefit from a comprehensive visualization
                        of their service, which has a variety of actors such as the customer, valets, valet
                        shift-captains, customer support, and back-end computer systems.</p>
                    <p>Included in the journey map was a representation of the various people involved, plus the
                        "triggers" such as phone apps and the car and keys. These became "swim-lanes" in the
                        visualizations of the service journey. Additionally, we described the emotional journey for the
                        customer and for the valet at moments of truth, and mapped pain points to the service map. The
                        map covered the entire first-time user experience.</p>
                    <p>Our team worked with various Luxe personnel to understand how the various participants in the
                        service interact. We were then able to relate user research with the customers and valets to the
                        journey map. The journey map is a great place for the in-house product team at Luxe to discuss
                        service improvements, and to visually map out the impacts of changes.</p>

                    <p>Included in the deliverables were three formats of journey map. The first is a stylized version
                        in Illustrator, which provides an easy-to-read visual snapshot of the current state of the
                        service.</p>
                    <p>The second and third are digital and analog sticky-it notes. The digital version is in Google
                        Slides with the steps for all actors, plus user stories for the customer and valet at each step.
                    </p>
                    <p>A journey map is a great tool to help understand a service and to find pain points and
                        opportunities for improvement, but in order for it to have maximum utility it must be in a
                        format that is easy to update in a collaborative fashion. The analog version was provided for
                        this purpose.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Now that Luxe has a baseline representation of the interactions within their service, they will
                        be able to use it to consider the impact of future changes. For example, shortly after this
                        project was delivered, Luxe introduced tipping for the valets. This will alter the dynamic at
                        the payment step of the process, and may affect the end of the emotional journey for both the
                        customer and the valet.</p>
